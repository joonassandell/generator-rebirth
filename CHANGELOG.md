- Project is now converted to Yeoman generator
- [Assemble.io](http://assemble.io) is now the default Html project builder
  - Jade -> Handlebars

## [0.0.5] 2013-10-18

- Now I'll be using the preconfigured grunt/bower config for future projects (/joonasy-bp). Yeoman is nice but it think configuring it is unnecesserary step at least for now. I should make some bash script for creating projects.
  - E.g. mkdir prototype && cp -a joonasy-bp/joonasy-bp/. prototype/ && cd prototype && npm install && bower install
- Grunt
  - Added custom modernizr building task
  - Jade for default marking
  - Use autoprefixer always
- Bower
  - Enquire, Respond, Fastclick, Normalize
  - Note: Remember to manually convert normalize.css to \_normalize.scss because seems that all the normalize scss versions add some unwanted variables

## [0.0.5] 2013-07-08

- Started using Yeoman/Grunt for it's flexibility. I'm not going to explain here all the features they have, so just look at the code.
- Bower is awesome, going to use it definitely
- Smaller tab sizing, better comment styling and made some minor structural changes.
